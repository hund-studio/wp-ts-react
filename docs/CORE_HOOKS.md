# Use Core Data Hooks to fetch data from WordPress

**wp-ts-react** use some custom API endpoints generated from the WordpPress COnfiguration to exchange data between the backend and the React frontend.
If you need to access those endpoints from you frontend you can create a GET Request or you can import the Core `swr` hooks from `@core/hooks`.
